    <p class="portfolio-text">EthereArt: “EthereArt sparks the heart and mind.” Inspired by nature, fantasy, the
      celestial, and all things ethereal,
      the goal for this branding suite (including a logo, letterhead, envelope, business card, and leave behind piece)
      was to
      emanate these things while communicating with the audience on an emotional and intellectual level. The starry
      composition of these pieces combined with vivid, contrasting colors captures the dreamlike essence that is
      EthereArt.</p>

      Chinese restaurant in town. With their slogan being “Quality, style, and good fortune to all”, I created a sleek
      yet
      inviting aesthetic for the design and coupled it with standout photos and important information so that they could
      truly
      give the audience an authentic look at what makes their ‘town’ great.

      La Piazza: An Italian eatery with New-York influence, La Piazza is famous in the local food scene for its piping
      hot NY
      style pizza. With growing social media accounts, it started a promotion that would give away its coveted pizza for
      free
      monthly to a chosen customer who commented on the original #pieceofpiazza post. They would then receive a message
      with a
      coupon for a free pizza. I curated the digital coupon for this promo, giving it a signature LP look while showing
      its
      correlation to the giveaway. With the allusions to Italian culture, a mouth-watering pizza pic, and the La Piazza
      logo
      flying high, this piece will have you eating out the palm of its hand.

      the
      Last Airbender-inspired metal band, Sozin’s Comet. This piece serves as single art for the powerful metal song.
      The last
